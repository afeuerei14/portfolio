# portfolio
##This portfolio contains sections with links that will be more of my work in the future. It contains information about me and how to contact me if any user wanted to. It was done by adding images to sections with links and later using a media query so that they would be next to eachother, then stacked 2x2, and then finally stacked 1x4. The about me section was made simply by putting a photo of myself and a short description, with an id tag so that the link that says About me! in the header could be anchored to that section. The links for Work and Contact Me were also anchored to their corresponding IDs/ sections. 
-The motivation behind this project was to have somewhere to store or link my future projects so that any user can look at my work.
-This page will make it easy for anyone to see my capabilities as wekk as information about me and my contact information. 
##usage: Click on any of the links in the header to jump to the corresponding part of the page. Click of any of the links in the My Work section to biew my other projects.
